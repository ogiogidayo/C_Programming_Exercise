## 0. Bitwise Operation
**00-02. Program to store prime numbers in a 7-bit unsigned char array**  
This program is designed to store prime numbers in binary format. The function Is_Prime determines whether a given integer is prime or not, and the store function stores the prime numbers from 2 to 100 in binary format in the array prime. This array is separated into every **7 bits** and each prime is encoded as a binary. The main function loops through this array and displays the bits in each byte. This results in the output of prime numbers ranging from 2 to 100 in binary format.

## 1. Program related to graphics
